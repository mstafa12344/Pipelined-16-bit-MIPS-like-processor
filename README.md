# Pipelined 16 bit MIPS like processor
Used Logisim simulator to model and test the processor.
## Project Description
Simple 16-bit MIPS-like processor with seven 16-bit general purpose registers: R1 through R7. R0 is hardwired to zero and cannot be written. There is also 
one special-purpose 12-bit register, which is the program counter (PC). All instructions are 16 
bits and there are three instruction formats: R-type, I-type, and J-type.

## How to Run 

- First, you need to download logisim app from [***Her***](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/)
- you can open the project from logisim and deal with it if you understand the building blocks.
- if you need to know more about the specifications you can open that [PDF](Project_Spring_2022.pdf)
